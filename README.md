You can see the live version on this link: https://nft-diplomas.netlify.app/

This version includes an admin view of the website, you can't add a diploma or change it but you can still see all actions done by a certain address, and you can see how add/remove roles form looks for adding or removing roles to addresses. <br><br>


REQUIREMENTS: you will need a MetaMask extension and connect to Sepolia network (just to load diplomas, you don't need to connect to the website because even if you do you will just have a default role - regular user role)  <br><br>


Short description of the roles:  

Regular user: can see and filter diplomas, can see more details about every diploma

University Representative (UR): can add new diploma, can filter all actions done by certain address

Admin: can accept/reject diploma, can add/remove roles, has a total preview of all actions done by filtering them by address value
