You can see the live version on this link: https://nft-diplomas.netlify.app/
This version includes an admin view of the website, you can't add a diploma or change it but you can still see all actions done by a certain address, and you can see how add/remove roles form looks for adding or removing roles to addresses. 

REQUIREMENTS: you will need a MetaMask extension (just to load diplomas, you don't need to connect to the website because even if you do you won't have admin role)

Short description of the roles:
Regular user: can see and filter diplomas, can see more details about every diploma

University Representative (UR): can add new diploma, can filter all actions done by certain address

Admin: can accept/reject diploma, can add/remove roles, has a total preview of all actions done by filtering them by address value
